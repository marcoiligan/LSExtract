Hi my name is Marco an aspiring software engineer. I have majority of my experience with backend and Database development. Recently I started my hands on web technolgy more specifically ReactJS along with expanding my tech horizon into Python and AWS (Certified Solutions Architect Associate). I am here uploading mini projects that can help boost my analytical skills and knowledge and make sure I am updated with current technologies.

Created this console program to extract data from Lightspeed Onsite API to a local mysql database. Created models and use my OOP knowledge to recreate the structure of the POS system and later on convert it to a brandnew system that the our family business could use in the future and still have all the past records.
